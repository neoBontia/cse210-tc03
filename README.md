Hello! My name is Vincent Jularbal. I am from the Philippines, eastern coast of the Visayas, province of Leyte (known for the Hurricane Haiyan in 2013). I like programming, back-end or server-sided, not really on the UI/UX design. I hope to learn more about classes and objects in CSE 210. What's wonderful about classes is
that you can create objects with them, then communicate and play with these objects. That's really cool, I think.
